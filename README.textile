h2. Bringing Holo Theme to Android 1.6 and above.
How to install ?

* Git clone in Eclipse

* Add HoloEverywhere to you project library (Properties//Android//Library//Add)

* I strongly recommand you to use the great ActionbarSherlock (www.actionbarsherlock.com)
If you decide that you don't need ActionbarSherlock, remove the .Sherlock themes in styles.xml

* Add: android:theme="@style/Theme.HoloEverywhereDark" in your application manifest, you may also want to test Theme.HoloEverywhereLight or adding .Sherlock to create awesome apps.
