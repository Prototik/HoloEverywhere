## What is it?
Bringing Holo Theme from Android 4.1 to 1.6 and above.
## How to use?

* You should clone git repo, init and update submodules:

```
git clone git://github.com/ChristopheVersieux/HoloEverywhere.git HoloEverywhere
cd HoloEverywhere
git submodule update --init
```

You also may use git GUI programs
* Import HoloEverywhere from root folder and ActionBarSherlock from contrib folder into Eclipse

* Add HoloEverywhere project as library into your project (Properties/Android/Library/Add)

* Add next theme declaration:

```
android:theme="@style/Holo.Theme.Sherlock"
```

in your application manifest
Example:

```
<application
  android:name=".Application"
  android:icon="@drawable/icon"
  android:label="@string/app_name"
  android:theme="@style/Holo.Theme.Sherlock" >
```

Also you can use Holo.Theme.Sherlock.Light for light theme and Holo.Theme.Sherlock.Light.DarkActionBar for light theme with dark action bar.

* Extend the Activities from com.WazaBe.HoloEverywhere.sherlock.S***Activity

Example:

```
public class MainActivity extends com.WazaBe.HoloEverywhere.sherlock.SListActivity { ...
```
Also you should cast view to with the same name from package com.WazaBe.HoloEverywhere.widget, if possible. This, for example, ProgressBar and Spinner.
